# Notes:
# - Many directives exist in specific ModSecurity versions (ModSecurity v2 vs v3), and
#   some are provided by connectors (e.g., Apache, Nginx, or standalone libmodsecurity).
# - Third-party rule sets (OWASP CRS etc.) introduce many rule-specific controls/actions.
# - Use the documentation for your installed ModSecurity version/connector for exact
#   syntax and availability.

# # Did we see anything that might be a boundary?
# #
# # Here is a short description about the ModSecurity Multipart parser: the
# # parser returns with value 0, if all "boundary-like" line matches with
# # the boundary string which given in MIME header. In any other cases it returns
# # with different value, eg. 1 or 2.
# #
# # The RFC 1341 descript the multipart content-type and its syntax must contains
# # only three mandatory lines (above the content):
# # * Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=BOUNDARY_STRING
# # * --BOUNDARY_STRING
# # * --BOUNDARY_STRING--
# #
# # First line indicates, that this is a multipart content, second shows that
# # here starts a part of the multipart content, third shows the end of content.
# #
# # If there are any other lines, which starts with "--", then it should be
# # another boundary id - or not.
# #
# # After 3.0.3, there are two kinds of types of boundary errors: strict and permissive.
# #
# # If multipart content contains the three necessary lines with correct order, but
# # there are one or more lines with "--", then parser returns with value 2 (non-zero).
# #
# # If some of the necessary lines (usually the start or end) misses, or the order
# # is wrong, then parser returns with value 1 (also a non-zero).
# #
# # You can choose, which one is what you need. The example below contains the
# # 'strict' mode, which means if there are any lines with start of "--", then
# # ModSecurity blocked the content. But the next, commented example contains
# # the 'permissive' mode, then you check only if the necessary lines exists in
# # correct order. Whit this, you can enable to upload PEM files (eg "----BEGIN.."),
# # or other text files, which contains eg. HTTP headers.
# #
# # The difference is only the operator - in strict mode (first) the content blocked
# # in case of any non-zero value. In permissive mode (second, commented) the
# # content blocked only if the value is explicit 1. If it 0 or 2, the content will
# # allowed.

# # -- Response body handling --------------------------------------------------

# # Allow ModSecurity to access response bodies.
# # You should have this directive enabled in order to identify errors
# # and data leakage issues.
# #
# # Do keep in mind that enabling this directive does increases both
# # memory consumption and response latency.
# #
# SecResponseBodyAccess On

# # Which response MIME types do you want to inspect? You should adjust the
# # configuration below to catch documents but avoid static files
# # (e.g., images and archives).
# #
# SecResponseBodyMimeType text/plain text/html text/xml

# # Buffer response bodies of up to 512 KB in length.
# SecResponseBodyLimit 524288

# # What happens when we encounter a response body larger than the configured
# # limit? By default, we process what we have and let the rest through.
# # That's somewhat less secure, but does not break any legitimate pages.
# #
# SecResponseBodyLimitAction ProcessPartial


# # -- Filesystem configuration ------------------------------------------------

# # The location where ModSecurity stores temporary files (for example, when
# # it needs to handle a file upload that is larger than the configured limit).
# #
# # This default setting is chosen due to all systems have /tmp available however,
# # this is less than ideal. It is recommended that you specify a location that's private.
# #
# SecTmpDir /tmp/

# # The location where ModSecurity will keep its persistent data.  This default setting
# # is chosen due to all systems have /tmp available however, it
# # too should be updated to a place that other users can't access.
# #
# SecDataDir /tmp/


# # -- File uploads handling configuration -------------------------------------

# # The location where ModSecurity stores intercepted uploaded files. This
# # location must be private to ModSecurity. You don't want other users on
# # the server to access the files, do you?
# #
# #SecUploadDir /opt/modsecurity/var/upload/

# # By default, only keep the files that were determined to be unusual
# # in some way (by an external inspection script). For this to work you
# # will also need at least one file inspection rule.
# #
# #SecUploadKeepFiles RelevantOnly

# # Uploaded files are by default created with permissions that do not allow
# # any other user to access them. You may need to relax that if you want to
# # interface ModSecurity to an external program (e.g., an anti-virus).
# #
# #SecUploadFileMode 0600


# # -- Debug log configuration -------------------------------------------------

# # The default debug log configuration is to duplicate the error, warning
# # and notice messages from the error log.
# #
# #SecDebugLog /opt/modsecurity/var/log/debug.log
# #SecDebugLogLevel 3


# # -- Audit log configuration -------------------------------------------------

# # Log the transactions that are marked by a rule, as well as those that
# # trigger a server error (determined by a 5xx or 4xx, excluding 404,
# # level response status codes).
# #
# SecAuditEngine RelevantOnly
# SecAuditLogRelevantStatus "^(?:5|4(?!04))"

# # Log everything we know about a transaction.
# SecAuditLogParts ABIJDEFHZ

# # Use a single file for logging. This is much easier to look at, but
# # assumes that you will use the audit log only ocassionally.
# #
# SecAuditLogType Serial
# SecAuditLog /var/log/modsec_audit.log

# # Specify the path for concurrent audit logging.
# #SecAuditLogStorageDir /opt/modsecurity/var/audit/


# # -- Miscellaneous -----------------------------------------------------------

# # Use the most commonly used application/x-www-form-urlencoded parameter
# # separator. There's probably only one application somewhere that uses
# # something else so don't expect to change this value.
# #
# SecArgumentSeparator &

# # Settle on version 0 (zero) cookies, as that is what most applications
# # use. Using an incorrect cookie version may open your installation to
# # evasion attacks (against the rules that examine named cookies).

# # Specify your Unicode Code Point.
# # This mapping is used by the t:urlDecodeUni transformation function
# # to properly map encoded data to your language. Properly setting
# # these directives helps to reduce false positives and negatives.

# # Improve the quality of ModSecurity by sharing information about your
# # current ModSecurity version and dependencies versions.
# # The following information will be shared: ModSecurity version,
# # Web Server version, APR version, PCRE version, Lua version, Libxml2
# # version, Anonymous unique id for host.
# # NB: As of April 2022, there is no longer any advantage to turning this
# # setting On, as there is no active receiver for the information.
